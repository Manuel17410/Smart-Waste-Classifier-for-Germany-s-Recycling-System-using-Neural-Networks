# Smart-Waste-Classifier-for-Germany-s-Recycling-System-using-Neural-Networks

This project uses a neural network to classify waste into 9 categories, including household waste, electronics, clothing, glass, plastics, paper, organic waste, batteries, and hazardous materials. The classifier helps users correctly identify the appropriate bin or disposal method for each item, making waste management easier, especially for foreigners. The goal is to promote proper recycling and sustainability in Germany through accurate waste sorting.
